I've got two things in this repository, but they're both intended for my python learning projects. 
Neither of these projects are for products, they are just for experience. 

The "count" side of things is for a project I want to complete, that has a full website interface, 
where you can add to an existing number, subtract from it, or set it to zero. I wrote it in python
even though it would be easier to acheive in other languages because I want to get good with SQL 
databases too, and this would require the data to be stored and retreived. Got the idea for this 
project from some video somewhere. 

The second folder is for my project Euler problems! I'm posting my solutions here (which is allowed
because they are for problems 100 and under), but I'm also putting the solutions I get from chatgpt
on the same prompts. I've been using the chatgpt responses and codes to make my own coding better, 
and showing me the next area I should try to learn. So yeah. Just more fun projects.
